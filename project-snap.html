                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, my group was tasked with finding a suitable social 
                    network and its corresponding dataset and coming up with a story for 
                    what this social network was hoping to accomplish. In our case, we 
                    found a dataset that shows an anonymous European research institution 
                    as a social network, where each node is an employee and each edge is 
                    an instance of an email being sent from one employee to another at a 
                    given timestamp (making it a directed temporal graph). Our scenario 
                    was that the president of this institution has a hard time organizing 
                    social events and came to us to figure out what an efficient way to 
                    organize social events would be, while still making sure employees 
                    attended.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accomplish this, we sought to answer a few questions: Which 
                    employee(s) in the network have the highest centrality? Are there 
                    employees who rarely, if ever, contact colleagues either within or 
                    outside their department? And what factors contribute to the 
                    formation or dissolution of ties between employees in the network?
                    By answering these questions, we hoped to find which employees spread 
                    news throughout the network the fastest, and thus which employees to 
                    inform first about social events.
